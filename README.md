# Coursera-Amazon-Data-Structures-And-Algorithms-Solutions

This repo serves to provide solutions to the Coursera Amazon Data Structures and Algorithms course graded lab assignments.

## Important
These files are the entire solutions to the problems and should work fine if you copy paste the content of every file in the **src** folder (others are output and temp files)
### OR

**Easier Method?:** You can open the link to this repo in the chrokme browser in your coursera environment and download the files you need from the src folder for that module and replace it in your working directory.

## Also Important
> Please do not contact me for  "HOW TO COPY PASTE DIRECTLY IN COURSERA ENVIRONMENT?"

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ad6dc89-9395-4ecb-8764-39f520cd26e1)

>How to solve?
Contact support via the [chat with us](https://www.coursera.org/hc/lhc-chat), type "Connect me to an agent" in the chatbot, then talk to the agent and say "Hi, I am unable to submit the assignment as it shows Error loading files in my Module 2 Graded Lab in the Data Structures and Algorithms Course" Kindly help me and sort it out. Thank you."

Then they will check and hopefully provide a solution.
